Followed a Twitter-clone tutorial to fully understand the technologies used to built for this project

I want to express my sincere gratitude to Antonio, the creator of the coding tutorials I have been following. Thanks to his clear explanations and engaging teaching style, I have gained a deeper understanding of how to apply different technology stacks in real-life applications. His tutorials have been an invaluable resource for me as I continue to learn and grow as a programmer. I highly recommend his videos to anyone who is interested in learning more about web development, and I am grateful for his contributions to the programming community.
